            Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical,
            or material world or universe.
            "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world,
            and also to life in general.

            Emerson says that nature is beautiful because it is alive, moving, reproductive. In nature we observe growth
            and development in living things, contrasted with the static or deteriorating
            state of the vast majority of that which is man-made.

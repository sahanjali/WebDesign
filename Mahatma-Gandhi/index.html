            Mahatma Gandhi was Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, western India, Gandhi trained in
            law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years
            in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to
            represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to stay for 21 years. It was in South Africa that
            Gandhi raised a family, and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights.
            Mahatma Gandhi was the primary leader of Indiaâ€™s independence movement and also
            the architect of a form of non-violent civil disobedience that would influence the world.
            Until Gandhi was assassinated in 1948, his life and teachings inspired activists including Martin Luther
            King Jr. and Nelson Mandela.

        <p>Gandhi was a prolific writer. One of Gandhi's earliest publications, Hind Swaraj, published in Gujarati in
            1909,
            became "the intellectual blueprint" for India's independence movement. The book was translated into English
            the next year,
            with a copyright legend that read "No Rights Reserved".[381] For decades he edited several newspapers
            including Harijan in Gujarati, in Hindi and in the English language; Indian Opinion while in South Africa
            and, Young India, in English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, Navajivan
            was also published in Hindi. In addition, he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers.
